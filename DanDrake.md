== Dan Drake ==

I work at the [[http://kaist.ac.kr|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST), although starting fall 2012 I have a one-year position at the [[http://pugetsound.edu|University of Puget Sound]]. I study combinatorics. I maintain the KAIST Sage server at [[http://sagenb.kaist.ac.kr|sagenb.kaist.ac.kr]].

I'm the main author of [[http://tug.ctan.org/pkg/sagetex|SageTeX]], a LaTeX package that allows you to integrate Sage code into your documents. 

I gave some talks at [[days9|Sage Days 9]], and put my slides, etc, at /Days9Talks.

I also gave a colloquium talk on Sage at [[http://skku.ac.kr|Sungkyunkwan University]]: the slides are at [[DanDrake/SKKUTalk|/SKKUTalk]].

I wrote some notes on setting up a (hopefully) secure Sage virtual machine using Ubuntu JeOS: /JustEnoughSageServer. I'm also expanding the notebook() docstring at StartingTheNotebook; this will likely end up in the official documentation, I think. Ubuntu has dropped the whole "JeOS" thing and I should update that document.

I was one of the organizers of [[http://wiki.sagemath.org/days37|Sage Days 37]] in Seoul.

My homepage is http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~drake and my email address is ddrake at member ams org. (I trust you can put in the dots and @ properly.)
