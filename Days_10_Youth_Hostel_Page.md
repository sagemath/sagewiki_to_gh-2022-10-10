* It is  a walking distance from campus 
* There is a limited number of twin bedrooms (4 to 5), which would cost about 23euros/night/person 
* There is a number of studios for the rest of the group which would cost about 37euros/night 
The reservation is now done. Everyone listed below has a room booked for the dates that are indicated in the table. I tried to do my best for dispatching participants in the studios and twin bedrooms, trying to optimize the length of usage of the twin bedrooms, and accomodate everyone's preferences. It was not possible to match everyone's preference, but I hope this solution is pareto-optimal! 

For any question, you can contact me at `clement . pernet [at] gmail . com` I reported in the table the kind of room everyone end up with. 

If you are in a rush, and still looking for a place to stay at, there might be still some studios left. In this case, please contact directly the residence.
