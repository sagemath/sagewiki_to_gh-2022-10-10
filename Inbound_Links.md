= Inbound links to sagemath.org =

There is many a website with a link to !SageMath,
or a database entry or a webpage about Sage.

This could be in

  * an index or a thematic list of software
  * a list of downstream software from one of our upstream packages
  * a list of packages for some Linux distribution
  * a list of upstream software from software using Sage

This page aims to list some such places,
in order to check and update the information there once in a while.
