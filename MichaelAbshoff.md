Hello, I study math at the University of Dortmund. Most of the time I spend with SAGE is dedicated around packages and their portability. I added valgrind support to Sage 2.8.3 and have been using various valgrind tools to investigate Sage's memory consumption.

I also recently become a release manager for Sage and I chaired a number of releases: 2.8.11, 2.8.13-2.8.15, 2.9, 2.9.2, 2.10 and 2.10.1-3, 2.10.4 (together with Robert Miller), 3.0, 3.0.1-3. Since it looks like few people want to do this job it is very likely that I will do a lot more of those.

== Task Table ==

=== Currently Working on ===
 * Probably chairing the current Sage release
 * [:solaris:Solaris port of Sage]
 * [:freebsd:FreeBSD port of Sage]
 * [:windows:MSVC port of Sage]
 * [:windows:Cygwin re-port of Sage]
 * hunt mem-leaks in C/C++ code of Sage 
 * [:DebianSAGE:DebianSAGE]
 * whatever else currently needs fixing

== Done Tasks ==
 * See the Changelog, the google groups sage-devel and sage-support and #sage-devel on freenode.
 * DMG installation image for MacOSX [other people did most of the work here]
 * make all packages using BLAS/Lapack use the Accelerate Framework on MacOSX. Patch for Linbox exists and will hopefully show up in Linbox svn soon

= Other Software Interests =
 * Linbox with MSVC
 * Porting mathematical open source code to Solaris, Windows and any odd Unix out there. 

= Places where I can be found =
 * google groups sage-devel, sage-support, linbox-devel, group linbox-use
 * [http://apcocoa.org/forum/ the ApCoCoA & CoCoA forum]
 * #sage-devel on freenode
