== Technical/Scholarly Publications mentioning Sage ==
If you use Sage in a book, paper, website, etc., please email me at wstein@gmail.com and reference Sage as follows:

{{{William Stein, Sage Mathematics Software (Version 2.7), The Sage Group, 2007, http://www.sagemath.org/.}}}

 . where you should change the version number and the year to reflect the version of Sage that you used for the publication. To reference Sage using Bibtex, use:
{{{
@manual{sage,
       Key = {SAGE},
       Author = {William Stein},
       Organization = {The Sage~Group},
       Title = {{S}age {M}athematics {S}oftware ({V}ersion 2.7)},
       note= {{\tt http://www.sagemath.org}},
       Year = 2007}
}}}

To reference Sage using TeX, use:
{{{
\bibitem[SAGE]{sage}
Stein, William, \emph{Sage {M}athematics {S}oftware ({V}ersion 2.7)}, 
The Sage~Group, 2007, {\tt http://www.sagemath.org}.
}}}
Also, be sure to find out what components of Sage, e.g., Numpy, PARI, GAP, that your calculation uses, and properly attribute those systems (for example, ask on sage-devel). Similarly, consider finding out who wrote the Sage code you're using and acknowledge them explicitly as well.
