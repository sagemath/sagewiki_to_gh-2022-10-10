= Sage Bug Day 18  =

The event will take place on '''Thursday, November 19, 2009''' and officially start at 9 am Pacific standard time and go on until people run out of energy.

Don't work on '''anything''' unless there is a trac ticket for it.

 * The base version of Sage we'll start with is '''4.2.1'''
 * For a trac account follow [[TracGuidelines|these]] instructions
 * We'll all be on #sage-devel at irc.freenode.net.
{{{
From Linux you can chat via a text console by installing "irssi", running it, and typing
  /SERVER add irc.freenode.net
  /SERVER irc.freenode.net
  /join #sage-devel
}}}
