= Sage-Combinat: enhancing Sage as a toolbox for computer exploration in algebraic combinatorics =

Sage-Combinat is a software project whose mission is: '''to improve the open source mathematical system [[https://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]] as an extensible toolbox for computer exploration in (algebraic) combinatorics, and foster code sharing between researchers in this area'''.

In practice, Sage-combinat is a collection of branches on top of [[https://www.sagemath.org/|Sage]], developed by a community of researchers. The intent is that most of those branches get eventually integrated into Sage as soon as they are mature enough, with a typical short life-cycle of a few weeks. In other words: just install Sage, and you will benefit from all the Sage-combinat development, except for the latest bleeding edge features.

 * 2008-06-19: MuPAD-Combinat join forces with Sage

    Sage-combinat was born as a partial port of [[http://mupad-combinat.sf.net|MuPAD-Combinat]]. After months of discussions and experiments, an enthusiastic consensus emerged in the MuPAD-Combinat community to join Sage. Sage-combinat henceforth became the natural successor of {{{MuPAD-Combinat}}}.

   The transition was a massive investment (and is not yet completely
   over): seven years of hard work to port over! However a lot of
   experience was gained since 2000, and most of the design was pretty
   clear, and we could *share* the work.

=== Code ===
 
Since Sage 6.0, the
[[http://trac.sagemath.org/wiki/QuickStartSageGit|development workflow]]
has been reworked in depth, and we are in the progress of migrating
the extensions as git branches. Here are some useful links:

 * [[http://trac.sagemath.org/query?status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=positive_review&component=combinatorics&or&status=needs_info&status=needs_review&status=needs_work&status=positive_review&cc=~sage-combinat&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=status&col=type&col=priority&col=milestone&order=priority|In-progress tickets related to combinatorics]]

 * [[https://wiki.sagemath.org/TentativeConventions|Some conventions and help with the new git]]


The Sage-Combinat extensions used to be managed as a collection of
patches on our [[http://combinat.sagemath.org/patches/|patch server]],
using a so-called mercurial queue.
Quite some stuff below is thus outdated, and will be progressively
replaced by information on the new workflow.
