Triangular representations are a versatile data structure for computing                                                                                       with polynomial systems; they are typically well adapted to handle                                                                                            configurations featuring some form of geometric content. Even                                                                                                 though algorithms for computing triangular representations have been                                                                                          known for a while, it is however only recently that the focus has                                                                                             been put on                                                                                                                                                   "asymptotically fast" algorithms and their complexity.                                                                                                        

We will review a few basic tools and algorithms, such as duality,                                                                                             lifting techniques, or computations in a product of fields. A special                                                                                         attention will be paid to what is probably the first non-trivial                                                                                              operation, multiplication modulo a triangular set.
