Pairings are bilinears applications that take as arguments two points on an                                                                                     elliptic curve and return an element of a finite field. Pairings are very                                                                                       useful in cryptography as they allow the construction of new protocols such                                                                                     as the identity based cryptography and simplify existing protocols such as                                                                                      short signature schemes. The aim of this talk is to review the definition of                                                                                    pairings and to present an implementation using the SAGE software.
