For any nights you're staying in Seattle, there are several good choices in the U District: 

* College Inn: There are shared bathrooms, but I hear the breakfast more than makes up for it. 
* University Inn 
* Travelodge (on 25th St., across from U Village) 

## Travel Info

The ferry schedule from Anacortes to Lopez is linked <a class="http" href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Schedule/ScheduleDetail.aspx?tripdate=20090914&amp;departingterm=1&amp;arrivingterm=13&amp;roundtrip=true">here</a>. The ferries tend to fill up fast -- make sure to be at Anacortes **at least** an hour to an hour and a half early. The WSDOT recommends an hour and a half. On Lopez, it's more like 30 to 60 minutes.
