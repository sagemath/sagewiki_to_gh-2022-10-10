# Jared Weinstein (UCLA) and William Stein (Univ. of Washington): Heegner Points and Kolyvagin's Euler system


## Description

The celebrated Gross-Zagier theorem implies that if $E/\mathbf{Q}$ is an elliptic curve of analytic rank one, then $E(\mathbf{Q})$ contains a subgroup of finite index generated by a single Heegner point $P_K$ which is necessarily non-torsion.   (Here $K$ is an appropriate imaginary quadratic field.)  But if $E$ has higher analytic rank, meaning that presumably $E$ has lots of nontorsion rational points, then $P_K$ is torsion.  Nonetheless, there is a remarkable theory of Kolyvagin systems which plays the role of $P_K$.  This is a family of cohomology classes $\tau_n$ in $H^1(K,E[p])$, indexed by suitable square-free integers $n$, which satisfy a highly restrictive compatibility relationship.   If just one member of the family is nonzero, then there are strong consequences;  for instance, the entire $p$-Selmer group (which contains $E(K)/pE(K)$ as a subgroup) will be generated by the Kolyvagin classes $\tau_n$ for $n$ a product of $r-1$ distinct primes, where $r$ is the rank of the $p$-Selmer group for $E/K$. 

Our group will be concerned with the computation of the classes $\tau_n$.   By the end of the workshop, I would like to see a table of mod 3 classes $\tau_{\ell_1 \ell_2}$ for the elliptic curve 5077A of rank 3, for different values of the quadratic field $K$ and for various pairs of primes $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$. 


## Project 1

Let $E$ be an elliptic curve of rank 2, let $p$ be a prime, let $K/\mathbf{Q}$ be an imaginary quadratic field satisfying the Heegner hypothesis.  Finally, let $\ell$ be a  Kolyvagin prime relative to the data $E$, $K$, $p$.  The Kolyvagin class $\tau_\ell$ lies in a modified Selmer group $H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$.  (For definitions, see Howard's paper, Def. 1.2.2.)   

(a) Assume that $III_p(E/K)=0$.  Give an algorithm that finds the dimension of $H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$. 

(b) If $H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$ is one-dimensional, then it must be a subspace of  $H^1_{\mathcal{F}}(K,E[p])=E(\mathbf{Q})\otimes\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$. (Howard's paper, Lemma 1.5.3)  Therefore $\tau_\ell$ lives in a line inside of $E(\mathbf{Q})\otimes\mathbf{Z}/p\mathbf{Z}$.  Which one is it?   

(c) Compare the $\tau_\ell$ from (b) (known only up to torsion) with those produced by William's function "kolyvagin_point_on_curve". 

UPDATE:  (a)-(b) has been done for the elliptic curve 389a, for discriminants up to and excluding -67, and for $\ell$ up to $3000$. Here is the Sage code: <a href="http://standalone.sagenb.org/home/pub/9/">http://standalone.sagenb.org/home/pub/9/</a>.  Part (c) has been partially checked. 


## Project 2

Suppose the Heegner point $y_1\in E(K[1])$ has been computed, so that its coordinates are known as algebraic numbers.  Compute the trace $y_K$ of $y_1$.

## Project 3

The Mordell-Weil group mod $p$ is a subgroup of the mod $p$ Selmer group.  The Kolyvagin classes lie in modified Selmer groups $\mathcal{H}(\ell):=H^1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])$.  For small values of $p$ (i.e. $p=2$!), directly compute these Selmer groups.  Use the existing Selmer group functionality in SAGE (for number fields). 

Go along the lines of the paper of Shaefer and Stoll:  <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.165.1056">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.165.1056</a> 

When $\rho_{E,p}$ is surjective, there is an injective map $H<sup>1_{\mathcal{F}(\ell)}(K,E[p])\to A</sup>\times/(A<sup>\times)</sup>p$, where $A/K$ is the degree $p^2-1$ extension obtained by adjoining one $p$-division point of $E$ to $K$.  Use Shaefor and Stoll's method to characterize the image of this injection.

## Project 4

Let $E/\mathbf{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with non-trivial 3-torsion in $III(E/\mathbf{Q})$.  (E.g., curve 681b.)  Let $K/\mathbf{Q}$ be an imaginary quadratic field satisfying the Heegner hypothesis.  Assume 3 doesn't divide any Tamagawa numbers of $E$.  Can $III(E/K)[3]$ be generated by Kolyvagin classes?  Here's how you might proceed: 

a) Use 3-descent on E to find two elements in $A<sup>\times/(A</sup>\times)^3$ representing a basis of $III(E/\mathbf{Q})$.  Here $A/\mathbf{Q}$ is the etale algebra arising in the 3-descent computation.   

b) Find primes $\ell$ for which $\dim\mathcal{H}(\ell)=1$.  Use Stein's algorithm to confirm (if possible) that $\tau_\ell\neq 0$.  Repeat until you have found two linearly independent $\tau_{\ell_1}$, $\tau_{\ell_2}$:  These should span $III(E/\mathbf{Q})$. 


## Misc

Finding the n-th roots of a point P on an elliptic curve even when they are not defined over the ground field -- this should be used in Project 3. This should probably be implemented in Sage as an option in P.division_points(n, options).
