Abstract:   In this talk I will discuss some joint work with Sami Assaf on the k-Schur functions.    Historically, the Schur functions have been an important basis of the ring of symmetric functions. About 10 years ago, Lascoux, Lapointe and Morse introduced a new analog of Schur functions which they call k-Schur functions.   There are many interesting connections between the k-Schur functions, Schubert varieties, Gromov-Witten invariants, affine Grassmannians, and tableaux combinatorics.    For example,  Lam showed that these elements represent Schubert classes in the cohomology ring of the affine Grassmannian when the indeterminate t=1.    It is conjectured that the Macdonald polynomials expand positively into the basis of k-Schurs for certain k.  In this talk, we will discuss the final step toward proving that the k-Schur functions are Schur postive via a computer proof and Assaf's D-graph machinery.    The required computation is a halting problem with a termination condition but no upper bound on the number of steps required to stop.     Along the way, I will include several  ideas for projects in SAGE that would be useful in this area of research.
