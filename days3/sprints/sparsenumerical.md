=  Josh Kantor: Sparse numerical linear algebra =
I would like to implement a sparse matrix class that has the capability to solve Sparse systems using the library SuperLU. I have an spkg that installs SuperLU into the sage libraries 

[http://sage.math.washington.edu/home/jkantor/spkgs]

For more info on SuperLU look at 

[http://crd.lbl.gov/~xiaoye/SuperLU/#superlu]

I am interested in other capabilities (eigenvalues in particular, I would like to work on sparse solvers first.)
