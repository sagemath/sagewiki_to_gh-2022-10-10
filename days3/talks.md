## Planned schedule

* Sat: Talks from 9-12, optional talks from 2-5 
* Sun: Talks from 9-12, optional talks from 2-5 
* Mon & Tues: Coding sprints, a colloquium talk 
* Weds: Talks & wrap-up all day 
Talks that everyone cares   about will be in the mornings, and in the afternoons, we'll have more   specialized talks by the same speakers. In the afternoons, we may   also try to organize various tutorials for those not interested in   the specialized talks. Also, the goal is to try to give something of   a theme to each of the two days. We'll have slightly fewer talks than   the last SAGE Days. 

The first day will be targeted to people who are not experts on SAGE,   which for our purposes, might mean anyone who isn't a SAGE Developer,   but might like to be. An example of this might be a "State of the   Union" talk by William in the morning, and a talk on what an   undergraduate can do to get involved with SAGE in the afternoon. If   anyone has ideas for good coding projects that undergraduates can get   involved with, let us know.  

The second day will be targeted at SAGE Developers. The morning will   be talks about things that everyone needs to hear about, and the   afternoon talks will be talks about more specified topics that people   might be interested in. So, using SD2 for examples again, we'd have   David Harvey's talk on SAGE Architecture, and in the afternoon,   Martin Albrecht's talk on F4. 

The colloquium talks listed above are two slots for talks of   general interest, but not necessarily about SAGE. A good example   would be Bill Page's AXIOM talk at SD2. These will be dependent on   finding the right speakers & topics.
