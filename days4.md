# SAGE Days 4

The 4th SAGE days 2007 was held the week of June 12-17, 2007 (Tuesday through Sunday) in room 238 of the Mechanical Engineering Building at the University of Washington in scenic Seattle.  It was also online at irc.freenode.net in the sage-dev room. 

The conference was fully funded by the NSF UW/VIGRE and PIMS, so there was no registration fee and some participants costs were reimbursed.  Thanks NSF and PIMS! 

The focus was on coding sprints.  SAGE Days 4 was a developer-oriented workshop, with plenty of opportunities for participants to talk and work with others.
