This page lists some configuration options that we will need for the new <a href="/days4/projects/nb/">twisted notebook</a>. 


# Notebook Configuration Data


## Global Server Settings

* Auth mode (off or on). If off, none of the permissions options appear.

## User Management

This is only valid for a user that has admin privileges. 

* Add/revoke admin privileges from other users. 
* Add a user to a restriction group.

## Individual Worksheet Management
