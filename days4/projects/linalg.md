* Nick Alexander (from UCI) and Thea (from SFU): I'd like to implement some basic** linear algebra over Z/nZ**, following perhaps  _ Algorithms for Linear Algebra Problems over Principal Ideal Rings _ (1996), Johannes Buchmann, Stefan Neis at <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/719844.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/719844.html</a>.   The algorithms of that paper apply to principal ideal **rings**, and in the case of a principal ideal **domain**, reduce to computing the Hermite normal form.  So this could expand to trying to compute the Hermite normal form in the manner of Steel's unpublished algorithm as implemented in MAGMA.
