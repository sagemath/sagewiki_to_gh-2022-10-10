# Hotel Suggestions

This information is from a telephone survey on May 15.  Rates and availability will probably change.  Feel free to edit with updated information, but please include a date with your comment. 

* <a class="http" href="http://www.silvercloud.com/university/">Silver Cloud</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Nice local chain, King or two Queens, approx. $165, northeast of campus, about a 1 mile walk. 
* <a class="http" href="http://www.travelodgeseattleuniversity.com/">Travelodge</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Budget, $119, northeast of campus, about a 1 mile walk. 
      * 2012/05/15 Sold-out for Friday, May 15, but you could get a room at the (more expensive) Silver Cloud for one night, it is only about a block away. 
      * 2012/05/16 $109. 
      * 2012/05/16 Expedia for about $80/night. 
* <a class="http" href="http://www.collegeinnseattle.com/">College Inn Seattle</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Economy, $90, close to campus, showers down the hall.  Only one room available for Tuesday, May 12. 
* <a class="http" href="http://www.universityinnseattle.com/">University Inn</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Some "Premier" rooms available, King bed and fold-out couch, $229. 
      * 2012/05/15 May have a small number of rooms (possibly only 1) left at their UW rate of $119/night. 
* <a class="http" href="http://www.watertownseattle.com/">Watertown</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Some suites, King bed with fold-out couch, starting at $157 if you ask for UW rate. 
* <a class="http" href="http://www.hoteldeca.com/">Hotel Deca</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Best mid-range choice, but very likely sold-out. 
* <a class="http" href="http://www.universitymotelsuites.com/">University Motel Suites</a> 
      * 2012/05/15 Sold-out. 
Another option is to stay in the "Belltown" neighborhood, just north of downtown and about 4 miles from campus.  Search for hotels near the intersection of "3rd Avenue and Bell Street" and consider the #71, #72, #73 buses departing from 5th & Pine to go out to campus.
