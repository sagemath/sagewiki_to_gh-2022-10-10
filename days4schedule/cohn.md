* Henry Cohn: 
   * - I hate the E.conductor().  I would like conductor(E). - Make it so SAGE can open any format file.  MATLAB can do. 
         * Load a jpeg; fancy demos. - Want SAGE to be able to text message you when a 
         * computation fixes. - Databases of math objects: 
                  * - should have 50 times as many - easy for random people to submit - e.g., I use Magma just for sloane's lattice tables, 
                        * which are built in. - refereed: people sign off on a database. - personal databases - Specific math that should be more developed: 
               * - Optimization: 
                        * conj grad 
                        * newton 
                        * grad descent - Numerical computation of f'(x) in an *intelligent* way. - Give easy black boxes for clueless people but well 
                     * labeled boxes for other people. - Linear programing: 
                              * the best free ones are all mediocre, 
                                    * so I have to use CPLEX (?).   $10-20K/cpu/year. 
                              * But we could do exact, arbitrary precision, and double 
                                    * precision LP solver that could do tons of comptuations with doubles without too much overhead. - Semidefinite programming: 
                              * nothing arbitrary precision available 
                              * implement a descent but not so super-good arbitrary precision 
                                    * would be good. - Automorphism groups: 
                              * nauty. 
                                          * But I want edge-labeled graphs!!   It would be tremendously useful to deal with edge-labeled (hyper) graphs. - Cellular automata: 
                              * make it easy for someone with no clue to get beautiful 
                                    * visualizations of cellular automata. 
                              * fractals; julia sets - Analytic Riemann Surfaces: 
                              * explicit covering maps in terms of hypergeometric functions 
                              * Bernard Deconinck (from UW applied math) -- maple code - Lesson plans: 
                              * Publish class-room tested lecture plans that use 
                                    * SAGE 
                              * Get undergrads to make lesson plans. 
                              * NSF GK-12: UW grad students involved in local community. - Publish idealogical articles in off-beat places 
                              * You don't have to rely on other people; you get to 
                                    * easily change things. 
                              * Students can makes things arbitrarily more complicated.
