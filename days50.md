# Sage Days 50: Women in Sage (4)

<a class="http" href="http://sagemath.org/">Sage</a> is a mathematics software package, developed by and for the mathematics community.  It aims to become a viable alternative to commercial software packages on the basis of an open-source model. 

This will be a 6-day workshop which will include a combination of mathematical talks, tutorials, demonstrations of Sage functionality as well as time spent on Sage development. We will focus on various aspects of computational number theory with the goal of increasing the number of women developers. 


## How to Apply

We'd like to hit the ground running this year, so we have a few more steps to our application process.

## Tickets to review

* Adriana and Ursula's group have a patch up on trac. It's ticket #14880 if anyone would like to review it. 

## Important Coding Lessons

* Sage is object-oriented.  If you're creating a patch that adds a function, your function probably needs to be associated with an object.
