## Train and bus directions

There are two mainline railway stations in Bristol, Temple Meads and Parkway. If you have a choice, you are advised to arrive at Temple Meads as it is much closer to the University precinct. Bus services 8/8A or 9/9A run to the precinct every 10 minutes during the day, and taxis are readily available. To get to Maths, Take service 9 or 9A, disembark outside the Hawthorns on Elton Road. Go across the zebra crossing (Woodland Rd), turn right, cross the next road, and go up the drive in front of you, marked Stuart House. This will bring you to the front of Royal Fort and Stuart House. To access the maths building bear left, past the front of the houses, under the arch (prince Rupert’s Gate) and turn right at the next road. The main entrance is a few yards along, up the steps to your right.
