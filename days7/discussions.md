## Acceptance Criteria for standard packages

This criteria is for _acceptance_ of standard packages, not the criteria for consideration of packages.  

1. GPL version 3 compatible license 
1. The package must build on our supported architectures and pass the worry test (e.g., what is the possibility of eventually using the package on Windows?) 
1. Quality: It should be "better" than anything else (that passes criteria 1 and 2) and the argument should be made for this.  The comparison should be made to both python and other software.  Criteria in passing the quality test include: 
   1. Speed 
   1. Documentation 
   1. Usability 
   1. Memory leaks 
   1. Maintainable 
1. Interest and Demand: 
   1. JSAGE vote 
   1. A certain number of sage-devel +1 votes (and sage-support votes) 
   1. How many downloads of the optional package
