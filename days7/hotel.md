## General Info

* You should make your own reservations by calling the hotel directly. You'll get to fill out the reimbursement paperwork at SD7.  
* If you're planning on sharing a room, you should find a roommate. <a href="/days7/roommates">Here</a> is a roommate matching page. 

## Staying 2-3 nights?

The hotel of choice is the UCLA Guest House. It's supposed to be nice, with an excellent location. Apparently the UCLA Business School blocks off the entire place for **every** Friday night during the academic year, so often IPAM doesn't have much luck with rooms there. Here's the info: 

UCLA Guest House   
 Charles E. Young Drive East

If you call and can't get a reservation, please email <a href="mailto:sagedays@gmail.com">sagedays@gmail.com</a> and let us know, so that we can update this with a different first choice for hotel.  


## Staying 5 nights?

Now on to the specific hotels in the area. We have reserved a block of rooms at Hilgard House, where we have 11 double rooms and 4 single rooms. This is an excellent choice for anyone staying for the entirety of the conference. You should say that you're with either "IPAM" or "Sage Days". (If that doesn't work, e-mail us and let us know.) Our block of rooms is reserved through Jan. 15, though we can still try for rooms after that, of course. Here's the info on the hotel:
