# Create a Matrix_numpy_dense class in Sage

PEOPLE: William Stein, Tom Boothby (remotely; available Monday after 12) 

SUMMARY: Add a new file `matrix_numpy_dense.pyx` to the devel/sage/sage/matrix/ directory that implements ``Sage matrices_ that wrap the raw data of a numpy array.  

ISSUES: 

* Sage matrices are 2-dimensional -- but really could be n-dimensional if the base ring is a tuple-ring say.  Interesting. 
STATUS: A dream on the horizon.
