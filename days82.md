These Sage days are a special event for women* who develop in [[http://www.sagemath.org/|SageMath]] or wish to learn Sage. They will include introduction presentations, self training,  and teamwork on
specific projects.

This event is fully funded by the [[http://opendreamkit.org/|OpenDreamKit]] project.

*The application / invitation process is limited to women, nevertheless all activities of the workshop will be public and open to every one.

== Venue ==

The workshop is mostly organized at a rented house in Ris-Orangis (Paris area, RER D):

https://www.homelidays.com/hebergement/p1594881

19 bis avenue des Marronniers - 91130 RIS-ORANGIS (around 30 kilometers soth-east of Paris)

Monday morning, we will be at [[http://www.ihp.fr/|Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris.

Instruction to go to the house:

'''by train: RER D, station "Ris-Orangis".'''

From Roissy airport: take RER B up to Gare du Nord then change to RER D to Ris-Orangis (direction Corbeil Essone, check on the board that the train goes there)

From Orly Airport : take Orly bus to Denfert Rochereau, then RER B to Chatelet les Halles (direction north) then RER D to Ris-Orangis (direction Corbeil Essone, check on the board that the train goes there). Another option is to take Orlyval to Antony where you can take the RER B to Chatelet les Halles.
