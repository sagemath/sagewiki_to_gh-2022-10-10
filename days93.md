= GAP-PARI-Sage days 93: Lattices in Lie groups =

This is the page for a joint GAP-PARI-Sage workshop (number 93 as a Sage days). The theme is about "Lattices in Lie groups". The aim is to bring together experts in the area (Lie groups / algebras, hyperbolic geometry, lattices, Coxeter groups,...) and software developers (Sage, GAP, SnapPy, Magma,...), that can work to improve the functionality of Sage or other open source packages, as well as the interaction among them.

The workshop will be held at Faber Residency (www.faberresidency.com), in Olot (https://goo.gl/maps/fBVWA8U2ncr).

Note that although the workshop will run for two weeks, it is possible to attend to only part of the workshop.

The conditions of the Faber residencies require that the participants propose activities mainly aimed at high school students, that can be carried out in English, Catalan or Spanish.

If you are interested in attending the workshop, get in contact with the organizers. The cost for semi-pension (hotel + breakfast + dinner) is 40€ a night thanks to some financial support from the Faber residency. Some extra fundings is available and can be requested to the organizers.
