### Housing

A handful of visitors will be staying at the Shuey House, while the remaining visitors have rooms on hold for them at <a class="http" href="http://www.hoteldeca.com">Hotel Deca</a> (4507 Brooklyn Avenue NE, Seattle, WA 98105). The tentative housing arrangement is as follows: 


#### The Shuey House

* Second floor (<a class="http" href="http://www.shueyhouse.com/second%20floor.jpg">layout</a>) 
   * Master suite bedroom: K. Wilson and S. Miller 
   * Bedroom 2: J. Balakrishnan 
   * Bedroom 3: C. Hall 
   * Bedroom 4: F. Hess 
* Third Floor (<a class="http" href="http://www.shueyhouse.com/thirdfloor.jpg">layout</a>) 
   * Bedroom 1: G. Moehlmann, R. Butenuth 
   * Bedroom 2: T. Occhipinti 

#### Hotel Deca

* G. Boeckle 
* D. Ulmer 
* F. Voloch 

### Getting to the Shuey House/Hotel Deca from Seattle-Tacoma

Here are some options to get to the Shuey House or Hotel Deca from the airport: 

* <a class="http" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/a-abc-transportation-seattle#hrid:keLb-JbNNBPNxcvoGUwIOQ/src:search/query:car%20service">A-ABC Transportation</a> offers a flat rate ($30 typically, before tip) for door-to-door car service. I (Salman) have used them multiple times, and they are my preferred transportation to/from the airport if I'm traveling by myself. They are a private car service (though they don't have the nicest fleet of cars) and are less expensive than a cab. Call  for a reservation. 
* Taxis from the airport cost about $40 (before tip) and can be found by following the signs in the airport. 
* <a class="http" href="http://shuttleexpress.com/seatac-airport/default.aspx">Shuttle Express</a> picks up passengers at the inner curb on the third floor of the Airport Garage. Call  to make a reservation. 
* There is a new light-rail service from the airport to downtown Seattle, but you will then need to take a taxi to the house/hotel (about 5 miles north of downtown). This is not a good option unless you want to spend time in downtown Seattle. 

### Getting Around

Both the Shuey House and Hotel Deca are close to the UW campus as well as plenty of restaurants, coffee shops, etc. You will find that you can walk to nearly anything you like from the house or hotel, so a car is probably unnecessary. If you do plan on renting a car, please let me (Salman) know, and I will provide you information on parking, getting to/from the hotel, etc. 

Seattle also has a well-connected <a class="http" href="http://metro.kingcounty.gov/">bus</a> system, which can be used if you want to get out of the University District and explore the rest of the city. Talk to Craig or Salman if you have any questions about riding the buses. 


### Map

Here's a Google <a class="http" href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=103028083620229012626.00048318482c1f79ef823&amp;ll=47.662107,-122.307487&amp;spn=0.008946,0.015814&amp;z=16">map</a> with the major locations marked. 

This is a <a class="http" href="http://www.washington.edu/home/maps/northcentral.html">campus map</a> that shows the location of Padelford (the Math department) and Savery and Thomson Halls (where talks on Monday will be).

   * Wednesday at 1:30pm in Mueller Hall 153: <a href="http://www.washington.edu/maps/?l=MU">http://www.washington.edu/maps/?l=MU</a> 
   * Friday at 1:30pm in Mueller Hall 153: <a href="http://www.washington.edu/maps/?l=MU">http://www.washington.edu/maps/?l=MU</a> 

#### Talk Abstracts

Function Fields and Number Fields (Ulmer): I will try to explain some of the analogies between arithmetic in these two domains and also why we can often do more in the function field setting. 

An Introduction to Sage for Number Theorists (Citro): I will give a short introduction to Sage, highlighting aspects that are particularly relevant for number theory. You are welcome to come armed with questions, especially of the "can Sage do <insert your favorite thing here>" variety. 

Drinfeld Modular Forms and Harmonic Cocycles (Boeckle): In this talk I shall introduce the main concepts needed to understand Drinfeld cusp forms and the combinatorics that allows their computation: The Bruhat-Tits tree, Drinfeld's symmetric space, the cusp forms and harmonic cocycles. I shall state many of the basic theorems including some of Teitelbaum's work relating Drinfeld cusp forms and harmonic cocycles. I will also present a (very incomplete and subjective) list of open questions. 

Computing Drinfeld Modular Forms (Butenuth): Drinfeld modular forms can be related to harmonic cochains, which are functions on the edges of the Bruhat-Tits tree fulfilling certain properties. In my talk I will try to explain how to relate Drinfeld modular forms to these objects and how to explicitly compute Hecke operators on them. The slides to the talk can be downloaded <a href="daysff/Slides_Ralf.pdf">here</a>. 

Calculating L-functions over F_q(t) (Hall): We discuss solutions to the problem of computing the L-function of a non-constant elliptic curve E/F_q(t).  Concretely it is a polynomial with coefficients in Z and can be computed in O(q^m) operations for some integer m=m(E) depending on E.  The naive approach via point counting works but at the expense of a 'large' m(E).  However, given enough information about one E/F_q(t), the relative cost of computing a 'related' elliptic curve's L-function is smaller.  One can consider a quadratic twist or, more generally, a 'pullback' and the 'primitive' part of its L-function.  We'll elaborate on these themes in the talk and introduce a library we are developing for calculating L-functions.
