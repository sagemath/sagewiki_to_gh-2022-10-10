Things I did a Sage Dev1: 

* Sage 3.0.3 release 
* work on building parallel ATLAS 
* pushing IML patches upstream with Arne Storjohann 
* ffpack benchmarking with Clement Pernet (70GFlops over GF(11) using 20 Itanium CPUs in parallel for matrix matrix multiply) 
* hunt bugs in modular forms code, pickling and python 
* quality improvement discussion of Sage - see <a href="/QualityControl">QualityControl</a>
