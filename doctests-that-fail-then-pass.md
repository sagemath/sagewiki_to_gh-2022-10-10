## Sage doctests which fail, but when later pass on the same system

It is not unusual for people to report doctests that fail on a system, but later pass. Sometimes that might be due to a lack of resources, though that's clearly not the only problem. Please list  

* Your name 
* Hardware 
* Sage version 
* Doctest 
* A link to the the actual part of the log file showing the failure.  
* Whether use used test, ptest, testlong or ptestlong. 
* Anything else, such as the frequency of the failures. If it practical to test it multiple times, do so.
