# Projects

Sage Days typically allow a great deal of unstructured time to work on projects, either in groups or with the assistance of experts that are available.  Please plan to have a project to work on.  Examples could be: 

* Learning a new area of Sage in preparation for teaching a course. 
* Preparing worksheets for a course. 
* Learning how to create interacts for the Sage library. 
* Learning how to contribute new code to Sage.
