# Budget

[[_TOC_]] 


## Rough Overview: no dollar figures, just *what you want*, e.g., summer salary, quarter buyout.

* Jason Grout (let me know if I'm being too ambitious here, since I have zero experience with writing NSF grant proposals) 
      * Summer salary for the duration of the grant 
      * support for several (2-3?) students for summer or year-round projects 
      * travel for me and possibly students involved to conferences to talk about all of this (e.g., Mathfest, Joint Meetings, etc.) 
* Rob Beezer 
      * Already have release unit for Spring 2010, will likely produce Sage primer for rings, fields, Galois Theory in undergraduate abstract algebra course. 
      * Have a semester sabbatical for Fall 2010 (or could be Spring 2011).  Another semester's leave would extend this to a full academic year for Sage-related activities. 
      * Very possible the second semester could be funded through a competitive program at my university.  I will also be applying for travel funds.  Applications are due early October, should know result before this grant proposal is due. 
      * So, a semester's buyout (if not awarded internally) would be the first priority, otherwise summer support to complement the academic year leave, and in future summers during the grant. 
      * Travel support for MAA meetings and Sage Days. 
* Mini-grants for faculty to write curriculum materials (textbooks/course notes/tutorials/interacts) using Sage.  Maybe a few thousand dollars each?  A summer salary, or a one-course buyout for a semester? 
* Summer workshops for each year after the first for faculty to write curriculum materials using Sage, i.e., Sage EduDays :) 
         * Regional workshops--there are a lot of smaller schools in Iowa, for example.  It might be viable to invite people from smaller schools in the area.  Also, there are lots of faculty in universities in the Southeast U.S. from schools with large minority populations that were exposed to Sage at AIM; maybe a regional conference there would be a big hit. 
         * National workshops (via AIM, if appropriate?)--invite people from all over 

## Detailed Budget: Exact Dollar Amounts

Below, talk to your secretaries and find out exactly how much what you want will really cost.  

* William Stein:

   * One possibility is 4 months total summer salary for me: 

          $12,732.28/month  (= 10,301 + 2,431 = salary + UW benefits)
          $19,862 through UW with overhead

   * Actually, I would much prefer 2 months teaching buyout during
     the academic year, using 100% matching funds from UW, which would cost
  
          $19,862 through UW, with overhead.
 
     I.e., teaching buyout at UW is a good deal, since the department
     matches.  They don't match summer salary.

     Also, I prefer to focus on number theory research in the summer,
     instead of Sage, which would be at odds with me being supported
     by this grant.

     I also find working with students on sage-related stuff much
     easier during the academic year, since I travel in the summer.

* [$62,163] Jason Grout: 
         * funding through university (Drake: 30% indirect cost, 8.7% fringe benefit rate) 
         * 6 months summer (2 mos x 3 summers), including Drake overhead 
         * Travel support - MAA meetings, Sage Days, etc.--2000/year: 6000 
         * Computer in year 2: 1,500 
* Rob Beezer: 
         * [$67,100] 6 months summer (2 mos x 3 summers): 21856 + 22293 + 22961 = 67,110 
         * This is actual salary, until I understand indirect costs, etc. 
         * [$6,000] Travel support - MAA meetings, Sage Days, etc. = 6,000 
* [$23,362.50] Tom Judson:  
         * Summer 2010: Prepare the abstract algebra textbook for integration with Sage, work with Sandra Laursen  and Marja-Liisa Hassi to prepare detailed evaluation plan, work on the educational research component. (1 month at @ $6675 = $6675) 
         * Summer 2011: Work on the abstract algebra book with Rob, continue to work on the evaluation and educational research components (2 months @ $6675 = $13,350) 
         * Summer 2012: Finish the evaluation and educational research components (0.5 months at @ $6675 = $3337.50) 
         * Total Budget Request:  $23362.50 
* Undergraduate Students -- all paid through AIM 
         * [$36,000] William -- 4 parttime undergraduate employees: 12K/year 
         * Jason -- 2 summer students, paid through AIM (at whatever the usual rate and hours worked is): (3 years)(2 months)(2 students) = 12 student-months 
         * Jason -- 1 part-time student during the academic year, paid through AIM at the normal rate/hours worked: (3 years)(1 student) = 3 student-years (academic years) 
         * Travel money for students to go to meetings about Sage: ??? 
* Sage Days 
      * [$24,000] Sage <a href="/EduDays">EduDays</a> (summers 2 and 3; invite faculty to teach about writing subject-specific curricula and using Sage in the classroom).  The first Sage <a href="/EduDays">EduDays</a> will probably be smaller than the second. 
      * Sage Days (at least 3, one for each summer) 
      * Sage Days with webwork/moodle people (summer 3) 
* Conferences 
      * Joint Meetings booth (3 years) 
* Advertising? (mailers/paper/etc?) 
* [$10,000 or $20,000] AIM Dissemination 
         * See <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/sage-grants/browse_thread/thread/581889719a14be28/">http://groups.google.com/group/sage-grants/browse_thread/thread/581889719a14be28/</a> 
         * David Farmer "$10K/year in seed money" (Note added Dec 7:  I'd like to make that $20k/year and also get someone to act as a editor of the books.  But only if the budget cap allows it. --David). 
* Test Drivers 
         * Faculty (N=?) who use Sage, and materials we create, in a course 
         * Stipend for a useful final report - $1000 (??) 
* Subject-Specific Guides 
         * Rob, Jason:  \$5,000?  One month summer salary?  One course buyout (runs \$12,000 at UPS.) 
         * William:  2 weeks work, $2000 
         * Number of these (per year)? 
* Support for Evaluation, Education Research 
         * Tom once said $30,000?  
* Improve Sage Infrastructure, emphasizing improving the educational experience 
         * William has about $68,000 of good ideas (exclusive of subject guides) <a href="grants/09/ccli/Budget/stein-ideas.pdf">stein-ideas.pdf</a>
