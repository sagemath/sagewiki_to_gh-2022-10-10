# Conference Call On November 5, 2009

   * Rob Beezer -- 3-minute elevator speech -- giving an overview of 
         * his anecdotes and history: 
                     * "This did not have the transformative effect that people 
                           * wanted it to." 
                     * A hundred sliders out there... but this is *integrated* with 
                           * a textbook. 
                     * No computer lab needed.  Any browser.  
                     * There are a variety of reason that mathematica didn't catch 
                           * on.  We feel we know how to address all of these. 
                     * "encourages unimagined new approaches to textbooks": 
                                    * korea; mobile phone page 
                     * many people can do what we're doing; tone down the "gee whiz". 
                     * getting everybody involved.  
                     * David: "creating things tailored to specific applications 
                           * that are going to happen". 
      * David -- everybody -- "why -- what are you doing?  what more?" 
                  * William -- selling point; "designed and started by students!" 
                        * aims at students, comfortable for students.  Today's students.  Our project strongly reflects student input. Everybody believes that student's know more about computers. 
                  * Tom -- texbooks onlines; getting rid of printed copies.  We 
                        * are meeting these needs.  We are the *only* group that can do this.  Nobody else can do this without a lot of money, agreements. 

## Tom: Report on conv with Sandra Laurson and Mary Leese

      * They are at U Colorado.  Doing an evaluation right now on a 3-4 college CCLI grant.   Michigan, Chicago, Texas.  
         * Help with: Pedegagy student outcome, curriculum Nope: evaluating technology (ui design, etc.) 
She pointed out that they don't care about "being free", but do care about what we do with the opportunities that open source textbooks provide. 

         * Question about impact of CAS has already been asked and answered. 
Brian Conrey: Do not give away to NSF what we don't know as far as evaluation goes... 

Tom had a very positive experience working with her.  

David Farmer: need to polish our grant a bit more before showing it to her. 

Revisit next Wednesday.

   * 

## Budget

      * Hannah trumps everybody
