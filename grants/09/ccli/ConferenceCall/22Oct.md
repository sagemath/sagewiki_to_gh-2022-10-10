# October 22


## Assignments

* Discuss in groups (using the sage-grants mailing list) a plan for specific sub-projects, and come up with a timeline of several things to do each year. 
* Come up stories of how to use Sage (vivid illustrations) from various perspectives (e.g., book-writer, teacher, student, etc.) 
* Think of people to write recommendation letters 

## Conversation Notes

* William describes the wiki. 
* Jason: the section-editing patch might make it easier to edit smaller sections of text: <a class="http" href="http://moinmo.in/ExtensionProposals/SectionEditing">http://moinmo.in/ExtensionProposals/SectionEditing</a> 
* Make sure to explain super clearly why this is a CCLI *type 2*. 
* Dan Maki -- Rob and Jason will contact him.   Program officer with MSP.  
* Get it into schools. Evaluate effectiveness.  
* How do places use the materials we develop? 
* Find universities not using anything and provide them with necessary support: this is not only for Sage experts. 
* Dept. in Texas very good at getting a large number of math ed in-service teachers grants; large math sciences partnership grant.  Got a supplement.    How?  Jump on plane, go to NSF, face-to-face, what do you want?  How could we make this successful?   Kim Childs batting average is 1000.   We should make a call to NSF and ask advice.    
* David Farmer: 'William is clearly not the person to do this, since he is an outside person, would appear to be just asking for something from this "big pot of money".  Rob Beezer is the one for this.  Volunteer AIM people to pretend they are program officers.' 
* Jason Grout: Sage-ify Putnam problem book.   There are many Putnam "courses" all over the country.   Worry: This could either add 2 percent or subtract 50 percent, depending on who is reading the proposal.  
* Tom Judson: There are a lot of sections; how can we actually do it?    What should we chose?  "We can assign people to each project, then integrate the results."  
* Need a timeline, clear list of what, when, and who.   Each group could independently make their timeline, then we can see how it fits together.  This helps addresses the issue of focus.  
* Division of work for now: 
         * The Sage Notebook: william (code), jason (code);  rob (test), kiran (test) 
         * Subject specific curriculum materials: rob (writing), jason (reviewer) 
         * Webwork and Moodle Integration: jason -- we shouldn't do this yet.  huge area.; future direction 
         * Sage Enhanced Interactive Textbooks: rob (code/write), william (code/write), tom (writing), kiran (writing); jason (code/review) 
         * Making Sage Classroom Ready: jason (code), william (code), tom (support) 
         * Dissemenation Plan: tom (ideas), jason 
         * Evaluation Plan: tom (ideas), jason 
      * David's job: make sure this is exciting! 
* Subgroups -- use the sage-grants mailing list.  
* Deliverable:  
         * Timeline with 3-4 things we should do each year: could be "work on my book, work on my book, work on my book" 
* David Farmer: 
         * A bunch of vivid anecdotes from different perspectives.  Nice stories 
               * and how to use them.  This is PERFECT for helping people understand and be convinced of the proposal. 
         * This was a good example: Rob's example: "Imagine a calculus 
               * lesson on Taylor polynomials as a Sage worksheet in a folder that comprises a calculus textbook. Sage input cells would instruct the reader on the relevant Sage syntax, and provide the reader the opportunity to edit the input to experiment with different functions and different degree polynomials. An included interactive Sage demonstration could use a slider to control the degree of the polynomial, and an input box would allow the student to specify an input where the function and the poynomial could be compared numerically. On each change to the two inputs the demonstration would automatically respond with a new plot of the function and the polynomial, indicating visually the location of the input value on the two curves, along with the two numerical values at the input, plus the numerical difference between the values. By opening up the mini-word-processor built into Sage, a student can annotate a copy of their text alongside the demonstration, recording their observations or questions, using LATEX code to create the mathematical expressions accurately in their notes." Rob: write more!! 
         * Textbook adopter, textbook author, student, etc., etc., make 
               * sure we represent every single perspective. 
   * Reluctance to use Sage because of lack of startup time.  Creating 
         * materials that make the adoption hurdle 0.  Picture senior person  who if they can turn on the projector and be off working on this  with no trouble. 
   * Textbooks, worksheets, "things in the can that are really obvious 
         * and make sense". Subject specific tutorials -- as broad or narrow as appropriate.    
   * Rob: discussion on material  
   * William/Jason: Interface to browse thousands of finely-tuned easy-to-use interactive classroom demonstrations. 
   * Recommendation letter writers...
