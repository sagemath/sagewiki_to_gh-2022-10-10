CCLI, deadline January 13, 2010 


## NOTES: August 25, 2009

Names of 10 experts -- not too closely involved in sage but *want it*: 

         * Nate Dean 
         * Michael Gage/Michael Pearson (webwork)? 
         * Chris Godsil, U of Waterloo (heavy user of graph theory, linear algebra) 
Ideas:  

            * Textbooks using Sage 
            * Tie in with moodle, WebWork 
            * Simplified and more powerful campus-Sage-server administration 
Tom Judson, names: 

         * <a class="http" href="http://www.ed.psu.edu/education/default.asp?which=119">Kathleen Hide</a> at Penn State did a lot of early work with mathematica 
         * <a class="http" href="http://www.mth.pdx.edu/~palmiter/">Jeanette Palmiter</a> at Oregon state who did a lot

What people would do if we get the grant: 

* Rob Beezer -- has sabatical, wants external funding for second semester 
         * "converting textbooks to be Sage enabled"  
         * "sage integrated into textbook" 
         * "view textbook within sage notebook" 
         * "high quality typography" 
         * "read/experminent/demonstrate ideas" 
         * "tinymce to annotate your copy of the book" 
         * "tom judson's open source algebra (?) book.  used by 4-5 schools, including berkeley, BU, etc." 
         * "sage primer on group theory came out of the book" 
         * "moodle integration" Jason Grout -- 
         * Make Sage "classroom-ready" (i.e., polish up, polish up) 
               * the last 10% to be really consistent and unified for undergrads 
               * linear algebra, graphing, graph theory (pretty polished + robert miller's fast graphs) 
               * David Farmer: do not use the word polish -- use the phrase "classroom ready" 
               * wide range of things to polish and document better 
               * tutorials 
         * standalone version local GUI that would interact with notebooks that use enthought's stuff: mayavi, chaco, etc. 
               * local responsive 2d/3d graphics interacts using matplotlib/chaco/mayavi -- Kiran speaks to how useful it would be to have fast 3d interacts in teaching.  
         * notebook input widgets (like Rado's graph editor, a matrix input widget, etc.) that work in the input cells William Stein: 
         * geogebra embedding (only 2d) 
         * david farmer: what we need is library of useful stuff that user 
               * can use to get going during teacher. 
         * evaluation capabilities built into sage -- system for gather information about how Sage is being used and other feedback. 
* Campus wide server, easier, authentication built-in to that, make it trivial to setup. 
* Library of interacts included in Sage

Technical things, beyond year one. 

      * David Farmer -- how will people make their books available online? 
Year 2: 

   * Recruit people to put books online in year two. 
   * Recruit people to make other classroom material (e.g., interacts) and contribute them in year 2. 
Rob Beezer: People would need some *guidance*. 

Some discussion about the breadth of CCLI type 2... 

Tom Judson -- so we will collect ideas, implement across several universities, sell and tie under one umbrella. 

It's all about computer use in the classroom, but integrated with entire all-online experience.  We are provided the tools to widely implement this. 

David Farmer: We are beyond "pilot".  

Jason Grout: Having a windows port will make a huge difference, if it is possible and fits well within this grant.   

William: The Cygwin port might be done soon and would fill the need of a windows port for most students. 


## For next week

Rough out a budget: no dollar figures, just *what you want*, e.g., summer salary, quarter buyout. 

Tom Judson: find out more about math ed research that needs to be done to evaluate the effectiveness of grant work 

Next week: 10am next Wednesday
