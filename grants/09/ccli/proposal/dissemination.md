\section{Dissemination Plan}


[[3 pages!

The is *critical* to spend lots of time thinking and planning about. Most people don't, and it makes a huge impact on whether their grant gets funded.

In relationship to broader impact, include a plan about your dissemination plan. 
Specifically, where are you going to go, what are you talking about, 
why they'll accept you, so:

    * put website into math dl

    * PREP proposals
   
    * workshops to help authors retrofit open source textbooks with Sage, or help open textbook authors initiate new books, with the goal being similar interactive Sage-enhanced textbooks

    * workshop proposals that may be included in the budget.

    * Get seven people that commit to using sage as we go along and are paid 
honorariums to write tutorials telling how to integrate Sage into their courses.
