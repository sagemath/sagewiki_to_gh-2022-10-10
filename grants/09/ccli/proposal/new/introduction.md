\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Textbooks and curricula in the computer age}


\subsection{Previous approaches}

Cited previous research should back up the advantages and disadvantages
below.


\subsubsection{Advantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item inquiry-based learning 
\item can do examples too large to do by hand, concentrating on the concepts
rather than arithmetic 
\item Demonstrated higher grades for lots of different kinds of students 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Disadvantages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Defficiencies in software (like no algebra, vector fields, etc.) 
\item Driven by technology more than by curriculum 
\item Costs (lots of) money (so diverse institutions/high schools may have
trouble affording it). Not just software, but also the style of having
every class in the computer lab---not every college campus can transition
every class to a computer lab. 
\item Radical departure in course style---too radical for widespread adoption?
\end{itemize}
