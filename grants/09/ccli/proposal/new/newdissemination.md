(I'm not sure if this paragraph should go above or here.  for now, it's in two places.)

We propose to create subject specific tutorials to answer questions such as ``What are the Sage commands you need to know in order to do multivariate calculus?''  We propose to create a systematic and organized collection of subject specific tutorials and interacts to include with Sage.  Some work has been put forth in this (library of interacts, Georgia Sage Days Primers).  But there needs to be a lot more work and infrastructure in place to distribute these with Sage.  Maybe reference the Demonstrations project?
