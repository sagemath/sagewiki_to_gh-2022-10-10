# Notes for the Next Meeting

Notes, ideas, reminders for the next iteration, in no particular order. 

* Pay for a small table (small was less of a barrier, but barely sufficient) 
* Pay for two chairs (even though expensive) 
* Have 3d glasses---they drew lots of people to the table and into conversation. 
* Business cards were popular and ran out, these are critical 
* Take a projector to have a large screen 
* Or arrange for a local to bring a flat-panel screen (with stand) 
* Hooks or string for banner 
* Decorations (helium balloons, bright candy, etc) 
* Stickers (slide into name-badge, then affix at home) 
* Sage-related textbooks 
* Have a 5-step Quickstart guide to using Sage: 
         1. Log into sagenb 
         1. Find a quick-start published worksheet 
         1. Evaluate a cell 
         1. Create a new cell and evaluate 1+1 
         1. Create a new cell and evaluate a cool plot 
         1. Create a new cell and calculate rref of a matrix
