* Star-P model: provide a networked remote engine that does a few BASIC BUILDING BLOCKS in parallel over the network and does them VERY well.  And that's it.  All code blocks. 
* Interactive parallel computation -- Adding one high-latency extra clever node to the cluster -- YOU! 
* Interactive parallel supercomputing -- not a paradox. 
* serial; task parallel; data parallel 
* 2-core -- is it worth 
* task farming: will it be the first large usage. 
* (L)GPL versus BSD - A <a class="http" href="http://projects.scipy.org/pipermail/scipy-user/2007-January/010602.html">summary</a> of this discussion on the scipy list: 
* OpenMP -- why not discussed much here.  
* How to USE pthreads??? 
            * - job queue - sleep/wake - when to use 
* C versus C++: why? which? 
* benchmark... 
* boinc -- can it be used??? 
* dsage compared to ipython 
* security -- task farming and malicious vandals
