Many of MSRI’s short-term visitors receive travel reimbursement and/or per diem expenses. If  you are not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, in order for MSRI to process your  reimbursement forms you will need to present proper documentation to verify that you entered  the U.S. in an acceptable visa status.  The tourist classification (B-2 visa or WT) DOES NOT  allow for payment of any kind, including travel and expenses reimbursement.   

If you are a foreign national entering the U.S. from abroad, unless you are eligible for the Visa  Waiver Program, you will need to apply for a Visitor Visa, B-1 business classification, which  allows for short visits for usual academic activities such as workshops and for reimbursement of  travel and local expenses. You need to obtain the B-1 designation on your I-94 card at the  entry inspection.  If you are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, you must obtain the WB  designation (Waiver for Business) on your I-94 card at entry. For more information about the  B-1, Visitor Visa, as well as information on the Visa Waiver Program, please refer to  <a href="http://www.msri.org/propapps/visa_information/index_html">http://www.msri.org/propapps/visa_information/index_html</a>.  

If you are currently an international student or scholar at a U.S. institution, please be prepared  to provide your passport and supporting visa documents for review. We will need to make  copies of the following documents:   

• Passport biographical page  • Visa stamp (unless waiver program participant or Canadian citizen)  • Entry stamp from your passport  • I-94 card  • Supporting documents:  I-20ID (for F1 visa holders, pages 1-3 of the document) or DS-  2019 (for J1 visa holders). J-1 Scholars/Professors should provide a letter from their J-1  sponsor authorizing the visit and reimbursement if applicable.  

Reimbursement forms will be available during the workshop. We ask that you come prepared to  pay for your lodging and other expenses. We will mail you a check a few weeks after we receive  the completed reimbursement forms from you. Please note that the deadline for submitting  reimbursement forms is February 16, 2007.
