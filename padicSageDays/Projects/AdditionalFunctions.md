Submitted patch for Artin-Hasse exponential. needs: doctests that verify that it _is_ the AHE; would be nice to have an argument (m?) that gives you exp(x+...+x<sup>(p</sup>m)/p^m) 

Got a copy of some sage code for the p-adic gamma function from Cameron Franc.  Optimizing. 

If there are other functions you'd like to see added please list them.
