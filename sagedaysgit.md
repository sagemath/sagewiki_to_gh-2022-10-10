# Sage Days 47: Transitioning to Git


## March 25-29, 2013, Portland State University

The aim of this workshop is to prepare Sage for transitioning to Git. There are three main components for enabling this transition: 

* Prepare the Sage codebase for the new directory layout 
* Create a set of development tools for interfacing with Trac and Git 
* Extend the trac's git functionality to attach branches to tickets 
A more indepth description can be found <a href="/WorkflowSEP">here</a>. 

This is **NOT** a Sage days to learn about how to develop with Git, hopefully we will have a Sage Days focused on that closer to the switch.
