We are adhering the IPAM policies on funding. 


### Lodging

IPAM has made a block of room reservations for the workshop at [<a href="http://www.thewestwoodhotel.com/">http://www.thewestwoodhotel.com/</a> The Westwood Hotel].  The rate for a room with two queens is \$TBD, we encourage junior people (e.g., students) to share a room.  The funding you will receive from the workshop will cover half the rate of a room at this hotel if you are a junior participant and the full rate for senior people.   


### Travel

We will contribute up to \$250 for travel within California, up to \$500 for travel from elsewhere in North America, and up to \$1200 for travel from outside North America toward your actual economy round-trip airfare expenses between your home institution and IPAM. Please consult [<a href="http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/visitor_info/policies.aspx">http://www.ipam.ucla.edu/visitor_info/policies.aspx</a> here] for IPAM reimbursement policies, information on airline travel and visa information. Federal regulations require that travelers must book and ticket their flight through a US carrier. This means that your flight must either be on a US airline, or if operated by a foreign airline the ticket must be issued by a US airline partner. Subject to this requirement, you should endeavor to obtain the best direct route, economy, round trip fare. If you are unable to find a ticket at an appropriate price, contact us at <a href="mailto:travel@ipam.ucla.edu">travel@ipam.ucla.edu</a> before booking. Please note that if you are considering driving a vehicle to IPAM for your stay, reimbursement is limited to an amount equivalent to economy airfare or the mileage, whichever is less. IPAM does not ordinarily reimburse participants for car rental expense. Prior authorization from IPAM must be obtained in the event that a car rental should become necessary. 

Please note that IPAM will be unable to reimburse you if you purchase a "vacation package" (airfare plus hotel) through an internet vendor. This is a UCLA policy and is non-negotiable. 


### Registration

### International Visitors

If you are not a US Citizen or permanent resident please be aware that you MUST enter the country on the correct visa to receive reimbursement. Please contact <a href="mailto:visa@ipam.ucla.edu">visa@ipam.ucla.edu</a> with any questions regarding your visa.
